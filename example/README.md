# `redux-loop` Example

## Client-side example

Open `./src/index.js` and follow along with the comments and code, including dependencies!

To run the application:
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

## Server-side example

Open `./server/server.js`. This example shares store logic with client-side example, but runs it on server. Follow the comments and code to get the main idea of using `redux-loop` on backend, including isomorphic apps.

To run server-rendering example:
- `npm install`
- `npm run server`
